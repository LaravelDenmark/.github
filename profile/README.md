**Laravel Denmark** is a non-profit association dedicated to strengthening the Danish Laravel community. Our mission is to promote knowledge sharing, networking, and collaboration around the PHP framework Laravel and related technologies.

### Meetups
Through our work, we organize **more than 10 meetups every year** across Denmark, creating opportunities for Laravel developers and enthusiasts to meet, learn, and connect. Our meetups are open to everyone â€” from experienced professionals to those just starting out with Laravel.

### Laravel Live Denmark
In addition to our local events, we host [Laravel Live Denmark](https://laravellive.dk), a yearly conference in Copenhagen that brings together **over 300 participants** from Denmark and abroad. The conference features highly skilled speakers, workshops, and plenty of space for networking and knowledge sharing.

### Non-profit Association
Laravel Denmark is driven by the community and led by an elected board. We operate under formal bylaws, and our purpose is entirely focused on fostering a strong, friendly, and active Laravel community in Denmark.
